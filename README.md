# Weighted Graph

Implementation of the weighted graph data structure. This graph is unidirectional, and is represented in the class WGraph_DS. Algorithms are implemented on this graph in the WGraph_Algo class. The algorithms include checking the binding of a graph, finding a shortest path, copying a graph and more.
The attached tests check the functionality of the graph and the correctness of the algorithms.

## Getting Started

For Getting Started the work with Weighted Graph DS do:
* clone this reposetory to your computer, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/davidfeust/Weighted_Graph.git
```
* copy *src* folder to your sourse code project.
* import the folder to your project:
```
import src.*;
```

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this project install Junit 5.4, then run the tests from *tests* folder.
